# Installing Ruby

There are a variety of ways to download Ruby, see
[their download](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) page for some
suggestions.

**Note**:

We're using the newest, fanciest Ruby (`2.6.1`), so be sure to install it.

Many OS package managers don't have it yet, though, so you're encouraged to
use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), a Ruby version manager.


[TL;DR - use rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer#rbenv-installer).

If you're using rbenv (or followed the above link)

To install Ruby

```
$ rbenv install 2.6.1
```
